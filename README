Implementation of a WebRTC client that uses WAMP over WebSockets for messaging.
To establish a connection a WebSocket/WAMP server is required (see my other projects).

Dependencies:
autobahn.js, see http://autobahn.ws/js

The JavaScript files must included in the order
autobahn.js (external)
channel.js
compatible.js
webrtc.js
